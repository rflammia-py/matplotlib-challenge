## Background
Given two datasets supplied by Pymaceuticals Inc, I began analysis on treatments for cancerous tumors. The data collected on the mice and the experimental treatments were then visualized to observe specific treatments.

## Observations

With a correlation coefficient of 0.84, the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume is very strong and positive. So tumor volume increases as mouse weight increases.

The Capomulin treatment saw the smallest volume in final tumor volumes. And when studying a particular mouse treated with Capomulin, the tumor volume shrunk tremendously over time. 

Capomulin had the most subjects per treatment. With230 mice, while the smallest sample was Zoniferol with 182 mice. The conclusions made on Capomulin are strong since it has a robust sample size, especially after I removed duplicates.
